var Object ob1 = {}
add(ob1, "keyname", "somevalue")
# returns "somevalue" for convenience.
get(ob1, "keyname")
# returns "somevalue", because that's the value of "keyname"
set(ob1, "keyname", "foobar")
# returns "foobar" for convenience, and sets "keyname" to "foobar"

# A more convenient method:
print(ob1["keyname"])
# "foobar", because that's what we just made it be.
print(ob1[0])
# "foobar", because it is index 0, and it's convenient
